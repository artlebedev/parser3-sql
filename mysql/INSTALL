0.Assuming your perform your builds in $D directory 
  and suggested subdirectories.

1.What is the process to compile Parser3 MySQL driver? 

  You sould have MySQL client software and include files installed.

  As most UNIX libraries Parser3 MySQL driver follows the "standard":

  cd $D/parser3project
  mkdir sql
  cd sql
  gunzip -c parser3mysql-x.x.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  cd parser3mysql-x.x
  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/parser3install --silent
  make


  In case configure could not find directory with your 
  MySQL client software include files, specify it with
    --with-mysql-inc=DIR        DIR is the MySQL includes directory
  option.
  
2.What is the process to install Parser3 MySQL driver?

  make install

  Installation layout:
    $prefix/lib/
      libparser3mysql.x     -- driver's dynamic library

  NOTE:
  make sure that Parser3 main configuration file, 
  	$prefix/etc/auto.p
  has in $SQL[...] configuration section a line like this:

mysql	$sqldriversdir/libparser3mysql.so	/usr/local/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.so

  which specifies 
    protocol name
    path to Parser 'libparser3mysql' dynamic library
    path to MySQL client 'libmysqlclient' dynamic library
      [you sould have it from from your MySQL client installation]
