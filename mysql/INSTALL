0.Assuming your perform your builds in $D directory 
  and suggested subdirectories.

1.What is the process to compile Parser3 MySQL driver? 

  You sould have mysql client software installed.

  As most UNIX libraries Parser3 follows the "standard":

  mkdir $D/parser3project
  cd $D/parser3project
  gunzip -c parser3mysql-x.x.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  cd parser3mysql-x.x
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make


  In case configure could not find directory with your 
  MySQL client software include files, specify it with
    --with-mysql-inc=/somewhere/include/mysql
  option.  
  
2.What is the process to install Parser3 MySQL driver?

  make install

  Installation layout:
    $prefix/lib/
      libparser3mysql.x     -- driver's dynamic library

  NOTE:
  make sure that Parser3 main configuration file, 
  	$prefix/etc/parser3.conf
  has in $SQL[...] configuration section a line like this:

mysql	$sqldriversdir/libparser3mysql.so	/usr/local/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.so

  which specifies 
    protocol name
    path to libparser3mysql dynamic library
    path to libmysqlclient dynamic library
      [you sould have it from from your mysql client installation]
