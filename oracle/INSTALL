0.Assuming your perform your builds in $D directory 
  and suggested subdirectories.

1.What is the process to compile Parser3 Oracle driver? 

  You sould have Oracle client software and include files installed.

  As most UNIX libraries Parser3 Oracle driver follows the "standard":

  cd $D/parser3project
  mkdir sql
  cd sql
  gunzip -c parser3oracle-x.x.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  cd parser3oracle-x.x
  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/parser3install --silent
  make


  In case configure could not find directories with your 
  Oracle client software include files, specify them with
    --with-oracleoci-inc[=DIR]      DIR is the Oracle OCI includes directory
    --with-oraclepublic-inc[=DIR]      DIR is the Oracle public includes directory
  options.
  
2.What is the process to install Parser3 Oracle driver?

  make install

  Installation layout:
    $prefix/lib/
      libparser3oracle.x     -- driver's dynamic library

  NOTE:
  make sure that Parser3 main configuration file, 
  	$prefix/etc/parser3.conf
  has in $SQL[...] configuration section a line like this:

oracle	$sqldriversdir/libparser3oracle.so	/u01/app/oracle/product/8.1.5/lib/libclntsh.so?ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/8.1.5&ORA_NLS33=/u01/app/oracle/product/8.1.5/ocommon/nls/admin/data

  which specifies 
    protocol name
    path to Parser 'libparser3oracle' dynamic library
    path to Oracle client 'libclntsh' dynamic library
      [you sould have it from from your Oracle client installation]
      which sould be followed by ? and parameters in form 'key=value' separated by '&'
        ORACLE_HOME=path to your Oracle home directory
        ORA_NLS33=path to your Oracle nls directory
