1.What is the process to compile Parser3 Oracle driver?

  Oracle client software and include files should be installed.
  Parser3 sources should be in ../../parser3 directory.
  Execute the following commands:

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/parser3install --silent
  make

  In case configure could not find directories with your
  Oracle client software include files, specify them with
    --with-oracleoci-inc=DIR      DIR is the Oracle OCI includes directory
    --with-oraclepublic-inc=DIR      DIR is the Oracle public includes directory
  options.

2.What is the process to install Parser3 Oracle driver?

  make install

  Installation layout:
    $prefix/lib/
      libparser3oracle.so     -- driver's dynamic library

  NOTE:
  make sure that Parser3 main configuration file, $prefix/bin/auto.p
  has in $SQL[...] configuration section a tab-delimited line like this:

oracle	$sqldriversdir/libparser3oracle.so	/u01/app/oracle/product/8.1.5/lib/libclntsh.so?ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/8.1.5&ORA_NLS33=/u01/app/oracle/product/8.1.5/ocommon/nls/admin/data

  which specifies 
    protocol name
    path to Parser 'libparser3oracle' dynamic library
    path to Oracle client 'libclntsh' dynamic library
      [you sould have it from from your Oracle client installation]
      which can be followed by ? and parameters in form 'key=value' separated by '&'
        ORACLE_HOME=path to your Oracle home directory
        ORA_NLS33=path to your Oracle nls directory
