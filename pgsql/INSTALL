1.What is the process to compile Parser3 PgSQL driver?

  PgSQL client software and include files should be installed.
  Parser3 sources should be in ../../parser3 directory.
  Execute the following commands:

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/parser3install --silent
  make

  In case configure could not find directory with your
  PgSQL client software include files, specify it with
    --with-pgsql-inc=DIR        DIR is the PgSQL includes directory
  option.

2.What is the process to install Parser3 PgSQL driver?

  make install

  Installation layout:
    $prefix/lib/
      libparser3pgsql.so     -- driver's dynamic library

  NOTE:
  make sure that Parser3 main configuration file, $prefix/bin/auto.p
  has in $SQL[...] configuration section a tab-delimited line like this:

pgsql	$sqldriversdir/libparser3pgsql.so	libpq.so

  which specifies 
    protocol name
    path to Parser 'libparser3pgsql' dynamic library
    path to PgSQL client 'libpq' dynamic library
      [you sould have it from from your PgSQL client installation]
